    <h1 class="mid">Description</h1>
    <div class="top-sect times-new-roman">
    <p class="text-box">Chicken stir-fry is a speedy dinner that's jam-packed with flavor! Just grab a large pan and watch how juicy chicken, loads of veggies, and a savory-sweet sauce quickly come together in this colorful, healthy meal. The key to an insanely good stir-fry is the sauce. In this case, diced chicken and vibrant veggies are coated in a rich, sweet, and savory sauce basically all the flavors and textures you want to experience in a stir-fry!</p>
</div>
    <h2 class="mid">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="text-box-list line-height times-new-roman">
        <li>Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast: Both chicken breasts and chicken thighs will work in this recipe.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bell Pepper: Red bell peppers are ideal for their subtle sweetness and vibrant color. But any color works!</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Carrot: I’ve cut the carrot into thin rounds for convenience, but you can also julienne it.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Broccoli: I think a pop of green is always necessary in a classic chicken stir fry. Don’t love broccoli? Swap in sugar snap peas!</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Onion: Either white or yellow onions work in this recipe.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Ginger & Garlic: Essential aromatics for any stir-fry recipe.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Green Onion & Sesame Seeds: A sprinkle of green onion and sesame seeds on the serving plate is the perfect finishing touch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="mid">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="text-box-list line-height times-new-roman">
        <li>Make the stir-fry sauce. Whisk together the chicken broth, soy sauce, sesame oil, dry sherry, honey, rice vinegar, and arrowroot powder in a small bowl.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Saute the chicken. In a large skillet or wok on medium high heat, cook the chicken with salt, pepper, and a little avocado oil for about 4-5 minutes until lightly browned. Then remove to a plate.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Cook the vegetables. Add a splash more oil, then saute the bell pepper, onion, carrot, and broccoli until tender.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Stir-fry everything together! Add the chicken back in with the garlic, ginger, and stir-fry sauce. Toss it all together until everything is well coated in the sauce – that’s it!</li>
    </ol>
