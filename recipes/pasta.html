    <h1><em>Description</em></h1>
    <p>One-pot meals are true dinner goals. Case in point: This Tuscan butter-chicken and orzo dish is as easy as can be and ready in no time, while still packing in some serious flavor. The power move that makes it possible? Cooking the chicken from frozen means no more stress about forgetting to thaw it out—and no more waiting for it to defrost, period. Exclamation point!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>4</strong> Tyson® Individually Frozen Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li><strong>4 tbsp.</strong> butter</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li><strong>4</strong> garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li><strong>2 c.</strong> halved cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li><strong>1 c.</strong> orzo (uncooked)</li>
        <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li><strong>2 c.</strong> low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 c.</strong> heavy cream</li>
        <li><strong>1 c.</strong> freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li><strong>4 c.</strong> fresh baby spinach</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced basil, for garnish</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>    
        <li>In a large, deep skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add frozen chicken, cover with lid, and cook 10 minutes per side, until internal temperature reaches 165°. Remove from skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In same skillet, melt butter. Add red onion and cook until soft, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and cherry tomatoes and cook until tomatoes burst, about 2 minutes. Add orzo and broth and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to bring to a simmer. Simmer until orzo is al dente, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally so the orzo doesn’t stick to the bottom of pan. </li>
        <li>Add heavy cream, Parmesan, spinach, and chicken, and cook until spinach is wilted and chicken is warmed through, 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Garnish with basil before serving. </li>
    </ol>
